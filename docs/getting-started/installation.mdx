# Installation

Leemons is essentially a set of npm [packages](https://github.com/leemonade/leemons/tree/main/packages).

## 1. Requirements

### Node.js

All the Leemons packages are built in Javascript, so it is necessary to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in order to compile and run it.
The version required is 16.14 or above, you can check it by running in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.

### Yarn

We use [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for managing dependencies, because of the way it handles `workspaces` in monorepos.

Once [npm](#nodejs) is installed the following can be run to install Yarn:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

:::note PRIVILEGES
Depending on your system, it may be necessary to run this command with `sudo`.
:::

### Python

Although Leemons is developed entirely in Javascript, some dependency libraries need to be compiled with [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

It is possible to check if you have Python installed by running in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

## 2. Database

Leemons will be prepared to support both SQL and NoSQL databases, but in the beta version only a SQL database is supported.
Follow the installation process for your preferred database:

- MySQL [macOS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/macos-installation.html) | [Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/windows-installation.html) | [Linux](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/linux-installation.html)
- PostgreSQL [macOS](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx) | [Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows) | [Linux](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux)

:::tip MACOS Users
On macOS, you can install MySQL easily using [Homebrew](https://flaviocopes.com/homebrew).

Run:

```bash
brew install mysql
```

and finally:

```bash
brew services start mysql
```

:::

### Database setup {#database-setup}

Once the database engine is installed, a database must be created for use in Leemons.

For the purposes of this documentation, we will always be working with the following database configuration:

```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 3306,
  "user": "leemons",
  "password": "leemons",
  "database": "leemons"
}
```

<details>
  <summary>MySQL</summary>

Let's create a database named `leemons` in your existing MySQL installation.

So, enter in your `mysql` console:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

And run the following commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `leemons` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'leemons'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'leemons';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON leemons.* TO 'leemons'@'localhost';
flush privileges;
```

</details>

## 3. Download

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="direct" label="Direct" default>

The latest version of Leemons can be run directly from Github.

<Box style={{ marginBottom: 40 }}>
  <Button
    rightIcon={<DownloadIcon />}
    onClick={() =>
      window.open('https://github.com/leemonade/leemons/archive/refs/heads/main.zip', '_blank')
    }
  >
    Download Leemons
  </Button>
</Box>

:::note DIRECTORY NAMING
For the purposes of this documentation, we are assuming that the folder generated by the archive, once unzipped, will be named `my-leemons`.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="git" label="Clone with git">

You need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to be installed in your machine, you can check it by running in your terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

Navigate to the path where you want to download Leemons. For the purposes of this documentation, the destination path will be `my-leemons`.

Then clone the repository:

```bash
cd my-leemons
git clone https://github.com/leemonade/leemons.git .
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Project structure {#project-structure}

Assuming Leemons has already been downloaded or cloned to a directory named `my-leemons`, you will see the following minimal structure (we hide some folders and files for display purposes):

```bash
my-leemons
├── examples
│   └── demo
├── packages
│   ├── leemons
│   ├── leemons-utils
│   ├── leemons-database
│   ├── leemons-plugin-academic-calendar
│   ├── leemons-plugin-academic-portfolio
│   ├── leemons-plugin-assignables
│   ├── leemons-plugin-bulk-template
│   ├── leemons-plugin-calendar
│   ├── leemons-plugin-curriculum

├── package.json
└── yarn.lock
```

### Project structure rundown {#project-structure-rundown}

- `/examples/` - Contains the application examples.
  - `/examples/demo/` - Contains the demo application we will use in this documentation.
- `/packages/` - Contains all the [plugins](../category/plugins) and [packages](../category/packages) of Leemons.

## 4. Database connection configuration

Currently, Leemons needs a SQL and a Mongo connection at the same time.
You can set the configuration of the database connection by modifying the file:

```js title="my-leemons/examples/demo/config/database.js"
module.exports = {
  connections: {
    mysql: {
      connector: 'bookshelf',
      settings: {
        client: 'mysql',
        database: 'leemons',
        username: 'leemons',
        password: 'leemons',
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 3306,
        pool: {
          min: 5,
          max: 1000,
        },
      },
    },
  },
  mongo: {
    connector: 'mongoose',
    settings: {
      database: 'leemons',
      authDatabase: 'admin',
      username: 'leemons',
      password: 'leemons',
      port: 27017,
      host: 'localhost',
      srv: false,
      pool: {
        min: 5,
        max:  1000
      }
    }
  }
  defaultConnection: 'mysql',
};
```

Set `database`, `username`, `password`, `host` and `port` to the values you [configured here](#database-setup).

## 5. Bulk data creation template configuration

While the development of our Welcome Wizard is being finished, Leemons allows the ability to install the platform thanks to our "Bulk Templates".

These templates allow the choice between three different programmes according to your needs and can be customized at a later stage.

:::caution Download the template and see the tutorial
The easiest way to understand how our template works is to watch this short video tutorial.

:::

### Template file

Once the template file has been downloaded and completed, rename it to `data.xlsx` and copy it to the folder:

`my-leemons/packages/leemons-plugin-bulk-templates/src/bulk/data.xlsx`

```bash
my-leemons
└── packages
    └── leemons-plugin-bulk-template
        └── src
            └── bulk
                └── data.xlsx
```

:::caution IMPORTANT
In the case that an external storage provider has not been set up, check that the following folder exists:

`my-leemons/packages/leemons-plugin-leebrary/files`

If the folder does not exist, please create it.
:::

## 6. Dependencies

Navigate to `my-leemons/examples/demo` folder and run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## 7. Run your Leemons 🚀

You need to launch 2 servers in order to run Leemons:

### Core server

Still inside `my-leemons/examples/demo` folder, run the following command to start the demo application backend:

```bash
yarn dev
```

:::caution BE PATIENT
Depending on the resources of your machine and the amount of template data to be uploaded, the bulk upload process can take between 15 and 20 minutes.
:::

If everything has gone well, the bulk data loading of the template will start and once completed, the following message will be displayed on the terminal:

```bash
BULK DONE Template loaded
```

:::note MAIN URL
The main URL of your Leemons application is `http://localhost:8080/`.
:::

#### Re-launch the application

In order to check if everything has gone well, kill or close the current terminal and re-launch the application by running again `yarn dev`

If everything has gone well, this time it will be possible to see the following message:

```bash
Listening on http://localhost:8080
```

### Frontend server

In a new terminal, navigate to `my-leemons/examples/demo` folder again and run the following command to start the demo application frontend:

```bash
yarn front
```

If everything has worked, the following message will appear on the terminal:

```bash
Serving!

- Local: http://localhost:3000
```

:::caution IMPORTANT
Don't kill or close your terminal while the servers are running, otherwise the servers will stop and the application will terminate.
:::

## 8. Test your Leemons 👩‍💻

Once the frontend server ir running, test your Leemons application by opening the main URL [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

# Docker Installation

Leemons can be installed as a containerized app. This is useful for automatizing processes and avoiding the need of installing all the required dependencies on your system.

## 1. Requirements

### Docker and Docker Compose

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) makes it possible to deploy all the necessary parts for leemons to work, making it fast, easy, and predictable. We use the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool for managing the multi-container deployment, so there is less work to do and Leemons can be enjoyed even quicker!

You can install Docker and Docker Compose through [the docker website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## 2. Download

First of all you need to download leemons on your computer or sever, don't worry, this one is the easier step :D.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

  Using leemons-docker in windows is as easy as run a PowerShell script, this script will generate all the needed files.

  Download the file ahead to your desired directory (keep in mind it will generate files).

:::tip Download name and directory
  We recommend downloading in: `/my-docker-leemons/leemons.ps1`
:::

  [Download leemons.ps1](/files/docker/leemons.ps1)
  <details>
  <summary>Or see the code</summary>
  <CodeBlock language="powershell" title="leemons.ps1" showLineNumbers >{leemonsInstallWindows}</CodeBlock>
  </details>

  Now you only need to run the file, this can differ based on your windows version:

  - **Windows10**: Right click the file and select `open with powershell`
  - **Windows11**: Right click the file and select `run with powershell`


  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux and Mac">

  Using leemons-docker is as easy as running a bash script, this script will generate all the needed files, if they are already downloaded, it will directly run leemons.

  Download the file ahead to your desired directory (keep in mind it will generate files).

:::tip Download name and directory
  We recommend downloading in: `/my-docker-leemons/leemons.ps1`
:::

  [Download leemons.sh](/files/docker/leemons.sh)
  <details>
  <summary>Or see the code</summary>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" title="leemons.sh" showLineNumbers >{leemonsInstallBash}</CodeBlock>
  </details>
  ::::tip For Apple Chip you must need add this line  
  `platform: linux/x86_64` in line 25 up at the line of `image:mysql5.7` at the same identation of this
    :::
  Now you only need to run the file, this can differ based on your operating system:

  1. Firstly, you need to open the terminal.
  2. Now navigate to your desired folder: `cd /my-docker-leemons`
  3. Check that the file exists: `ls leemons.sh`, it should print the file name, otherwise, review the path
  4. Finally, run the script with `sh leemons.sh`

:::tip
Some operating systems let you drag and drop the folder to your terminal to paste the path, you can type `cd` and drag and drop it to complete the command.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once running, it will start downloading some files and docker stuff (it may take a few minutes), once ready, you should see something like this:

![Leemons backend server being initialized when printing 'Listening on http://localhost:8080'](/img/docker/serverReady.png)

When the server is ready, open a new tab in your browser, and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## 3. Bulk data creation template configuration

:::warning NOT SUPPORTED YET
Currently the bulk templates are not yet supported for docker
:::

## 4. Initial configuration

The first run you will need to set up some things, follow the steps and enter your information.

Once you get to the email provider, we recommend using a *free smtp server*, or if you have one, go and try it.

:::tip
We recommend using [this free smtp server](https://www.wpoven.com/tools/free-smtp-server-for-testing), we have tried it and works like a charm.
:::

## 5. Database

Leemons docker uses a MySQL server internally, which is configured through the .env file in your directory

## 6. Reset the installation

In order to reset your Leemons installation, you need to clean your docker images, this can be done with the following command inside your `my-docker-leemons` directory:

```bash
docker-compose down;
docker rmi --force $(docker images leemonade/leemons -q);
```
